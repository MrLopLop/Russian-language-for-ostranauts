In the early days of Venusian aerostat development, Hora worked in contracting and eventually materials acquisition, and was thus vital in the construction of both NewCal and Encantado.\n\nUsing resources and relationships cultivated in the construction of the latter, Hora began the Grande Prêmio do Encantado and eventually established the nearby Sol Vermelho Lounge. According to the case built against him by law enforcement, at the time of his arrest Hora's criminal empire included race fixing, labor bribery, contract embezzlement, intimidation, piracy, and contract killing.\n\nAs part of the terms of his arrest, most of Hora's assets were turned over to a prominent Venusian business mogul, including ownership of the Sol Vermelho Lounge.",

The list of modules includes:\n\n<b>Core:</b> The chamber where the reaction occurs, and a \"head\" unit for tying the modules together. Includes a power input, power output, and user control panel point, plus a series of 12 module inputs (3 to a side). Each module input is able to provide all necessary inputs/outputs for an attached module.\n\n<b>Laser Array:</b> Used to implode the fuel pellet, creating fusion for an instant. Requires a large amount of energy to fire, provided by the Laser Capacitor. Each laser requires one pellet feeder to provide pellet targets in the core. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Laser Capacitor:</b> High energy capacitor used to store power until there is enough to fire the lasers. One capacitor can serve up to 2 lasers. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Pellet Feeder:</b> Used to fire fuel pellets into the reactor core where the laser can fire at them. Requires a supply of D2O/He3 pellets, provided by the Fuel Regulator. Each pellet feeder requires one laser to target its delivered payloads. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Fuel Regulator:</b> Reactant processing module that takes D2O and He3 from their respective tanks and combines them into pellets for the pellet feeder. One fuel regulator can serve up to 2 pellet feeders. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Cryo Pump:</b> Used to pump cryogenic He through the reactor and components to protect them from extreme heat generated by the reaction. Requires a Cryo Tank installed somewhere on the ship as a reservoir. More than one cryo pump can be installed for added cooling, which can be useful in setups where the reactor is expected to run in CLOSED CYCLE mode. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Field Coil:</b> This is a powerful electromagnet that must be installed below the reactor core, and which is necessary to contain (and direct) the high energy reaction away from the ship. The FWD coil acts as a barrier between the reaction and the ship, and the READ coil acts as an aperture to control exhaust/thrust.\n\n<b>MHD Generator:</b> An optional magnetohydrodynamic generator can be added to any reactor, which will syphon a portion of the reaction exhaust to produce electricity for recharging the ship. Attaches to a core module input.\n\n<b>Core Pump:</b> An optional gas pump attached to the core for evacuating the core. Fusion ignition requires a near vacuum in the core, and in cases where the ship is located in a non-vacuum environment (such as a planet), this pump is necessary to reduce the core pressure below ambient. Attaches to a core module input.",

Simply go down the list, activating each module in turn, until all lights are green. The lamps will show green when the system is working normally, red when the system is present but offline, and no light if the system is damaged or missing.\n\nIt is technically possible to run the reactor without certain systems, such as the MHD, Cryo, Core Pump, and Field Coils. However, doing so should only be done with a full understanding of the risks involved.\n\n<b>FLOW Slider</b>\nThe FLOW slider controls the rate at which fuel pellets are being fed into the core and ignited by the lasers. The minimum setting is the amount necessary to sustain a reaction, and the maximum represents the fastest rate at which pellets and lasers can process fuel. A mismatched number of pellet feeders and lasers will limit the maximum FLOW rate to whichever is lower.\n\nNote that increasing the FLOW will increase the rate of reactant fuel uses, as well as the core temperature and pressure.\n\n<b>CYCLE Slider</b>\nThe CYCLE slider controls the aperture of the REAR Field Coil, which can allow the fusion reaction to exhaust out of the core, providing thrust. CYCLE CLOSED means the reaction is fully contained, which CYCLE OPEN increases the aperture for maximum thrust.\n\nNote that opening the CYCLE will cause pressure and temperature in the core to decrease, reducing the thrust and power created by the core.",

This wall has a finite capacity before it requires replacement.\n\nWhile the reactor temperature is in the green zone or lower, the ablative wall can absorb excess radiation with minimal damage. Exceeding the green core temperature range will begin to deplete the ablative core liner at increasing rates.\n\nThe CORE LINER lamp will begin flashing when it is time to replace the core liner. The lamp will remain on steady when the liner is dangerously weakened. The X-RAY lamp will turn on when dangerous X-Rays are being detected outside the core, usually due to total ablative core liner depletion.\n\nIf the reactor continues to run with the ablative core liner depleted, it will become more and more damaged. If the core becomes too damaged, it will become breached, at which point the core will rupture in a violent explosion, irradiating all aboard the ship.\n\n<b>Module Wear and Damage</b>\nThe core and all modules can wear out over time from use, as well as be damaged. In most cases, a worn module is less effective than a new one. So it may become necessary to adjust reactor controls to compensate.",

It accepted large contracts from Mars, Earth, and the Belt, and attracted talent and immigration from across the System. Later the corporation would accept material and financial assistance from Tharsis to upgrade its infrastructure with a view to it becoming an official territory of Tharsis. However, after several initial payments, negotiations between the two parties stalled. The materials meant for a command and control center were allegedly used to build the Harbourmaster's Residence, a lavish tied accommodation for the position.\n\nAfter Kessler Syndrome, and losing one of its biggest contracts, K-Leg has invested heavily in its shipyards and retrofitting services in an attempt to forestall long term economic decay.",

The relatively hospitable conditions on Ganymede - the presence of a magnetosphere, mild background radiation, heated regolith from tidal flexing, and surface ice and other minerals which could be accessed by small scale industry - encouraged private or 'wildcat' colonialism. Relationships between Ganymede City, other national colonies, and the wildcat colonies were at first mutually supportive, but soured as corporate interests attempted to prevent outgoing aid and/or trade. The corporations' hostile attitude toward the wildcat colonies mounted for decades. It finally exploded into what is sometimes known as the Ganymede Coup, or as the War of Galilean Self Determination.\n\nThe Galilean Confederacy, largely composed of Old-American nationals, currently controls the region, and the amalgamated settlements, by virtue of holding two of the three spaceports on Ganymede and Porto Nuevo at Europa.

These detectives, often posing as labour for hire, would search the stakes for anything criminal or immoral which their contract holders could use to leverage public interests against the colonists, and then force the authorities to take action. The colonists, however, quickly grew accustomed to this skulduggery, and their reprisals against the spies were brutal.\n\n<b>The McCluskey Killings</b>\nThe friction between corporations and freeholders came to a head when Obeid responded in force to the execution of one of its agents. A posse of twelve heavily armed detectives entered McCluskey, subdued the adult men and women, and one by one removed their helmets in the settlement's courtyard, lethally exposing them to Ganymede's thin atmosphere. Microlight drone footage of the event was leaked back to the cities. In response, six other homesteads formed a posse numbering fifty-two, and retook the compound in a one-sided firefight.\n\nAs the second posse retreated with the rescued adults and children, gunships from Ganymede City arrived. After firing air to ground smart missiles at the homesteaders, the gunships were seen to break off, and the few remaining homesteaders fled. The order to stop the attack was found to have originated within the Governor's office, and then from Governor Simpson herself, leading to her resignation one week later.",

While former Governor Simpson joined the wildcat colonists at Essex, a revolutionary mob in Ganymede City lynched her replacement, Carl Stoupis, an Allied Chemicals executive. In Xilai, revolutionaries destroyed a hydrox facility and commandeered three interplanetary freighters in drydock. In Novo Salvador rioting and looting by Confederates left sixteen dead to decompression.\n\nGanymede authorities were unequipped to handle organised dissension, and sent for assistance from private military forces in Ceres. From request to arrival, this process took well over a month. In the intervening period, the militias on Ganymede made contact with each other and set about waging guerrilla warfare on the major cities. The defenders, though better armed and trained, were fewer in number, and rapidly losing public support as pro-revolutionary propaganda flooded local feeds. The assassination of the exiled Governor Simpson by Obeid detectives backfired spectacularly, effectively martyring her. After Ganymede City fell to the Confederacy, it was renamed Fort Simpson in her honour, amid frantic attempts to fortify the colony against the approaching Ceresian forces.\n\nColonies at Io and Callisto declared their allegiance to the new Confederacy, however their relative size resulted in commensurately fewer and smaller revolutionary actions.

Nevertheless the cities refused the terms offered by the hostile military and resolutely prepared to fight. The unlikely victory of the Confederacy is attributed to the devastating effects of a few key orbital defences disguised as asteroids or space debris. The Guns of Ganymede, as they are known, fragmented many of the decelerating mercenary ships, severely limiting their offensive capabilities, though the guns were quickly destroyed by the invaders once they were known. In the end, after landings at Xilai and Fort Simpson and initially successful surface battles, the mercenaries withdrew, citing a contract dispute and unpaid damages. The older colonial interests were unwilling to continue hostilities. The Galilean Confederacy had survived.\n\nOver the next year, the Confederacy divided its territory into states according to its constituent factions, and incarcerated both dissenters and enemy sympathisers. The abuses of human rights by the early Confederacy, including indefinite detention without trial, torture, and unlawful executions, are a matter of record offworld, though strongly denied by its current leadership. In response to Europa's continued neutrality, Confederate ships blockaded its spaceport, without apparent effect.\n\nNearby, mines belonging to Troy Jupiter suffered month-long strikes at Jupiter's L4 supercluster, copycats inspired by the Galilean saga. These strikes were ultimately viciously quelled, as the miners lacked the resources, personnel, and other advantages of the Galilean moons.",

However, space tourism did not become a viable industry until much later in the century, and not at Luna, as the majority of the early emigrants from Earth were blue-collar labourers bound for the Belt, Mars, and lucrative Outer System stakes.\n\nWhen Xinhua overthrew Old China in 2051, many in the Communist Party fled to Pakistan; fewer still were able to travel in secret to Jade Rabbit, where the leadership had publicly denounced the new regime. Diplomatic efforts by Xinhua to (re)assert its ownership of Jade Rabbit lasted until 2059 when they were halted by Kessler Syndrome. Jade Rabbit's intermittent communication with Xinhua is one of the few sources of information in the System about Earth, though many claim it to be false given Jade Rabbit's refusal to explain how they have this link.",

    "strDesc" : "Much of Luna's infrastructure was never finished, and was abandoned as business interests left for Mars and the Belt. Workers walked off excavation sites mid-development, leaving wiring exposed, enormous mining drones idle or even actively digging, processed meals and card games lying in tableaux to gather dust, preserved by vacuum. Launch facilities might feature two completed launchpads, but a grid of zoning beacons show where another seven were due. A maglev network between Jade Rabbit and prominent settlements was never finished, and major lines end abruptly in half-dug trenches waiting for supporting pylons. Settlements not connected by the maglev largely failed, leading to economic depression and ghost towns.\n\nThe prevalence of empty and unfinished living areas and disused launch facilities made Luna attractive to squatters and other persons living outside the law. Luna has a large transient population who, by and large, lead lives made dangerous and desperate without the support of social services or basic necessities. Entering abandoned compounds on Luna stands a fair chance of finding its transient population dead from starvation or asphyxiation, or alive but hostile and envious of newcomers.\n\nLuna's livelihood is in the Helium-3 mining and processing facilities at Jade Rabbit. Jade Rabbit can't compete with the abundance of resources at Uranus, Saturn and Neptune, but it boasts the most mature extraction process in the system, the mining having begun in the infancy of space colonisation. The smaller overhead when shipping fuel to the Inner System allows it to remain competitive. Lunar shipping companies put fuel barges into low energy transfer orbits, allowing these 'slowboats' to travel to Inner System destinations for a fraction of the cost of a regular burn, but over the course of weeks or months.",

A prolonged campaign of both nonviolent and violent resistance began. Four successive wardens of Noctis either resigned or fell victim to violence in Noctis. In 2041, representatives of Tharsis entered negotiations with resistance leaders to grant the Noctis Facility its independence. The winner of the first open elections was the Humanist Movement.

Eighteen months prior, Tharsis was a dig site, its population living in prefabbed bubbles on the surface while working to expand the subterranean lava tube network. The bulkheads of the first pressurised tunnel were erected in 2029 in what is now Xinhua Square. Administrator Kung died in 2030 from the effects of overwork and prolonged radiation exposure, and many parts of Tharsis were named to honour his memory.\n\nTharsis expanded rapidly throughout the next decade, but even so development often did not keep up with immigration. To combat the problem of unlawful immigration and homelessness, Tharsis established the Noctis Regional Processing Facility in 2033. Public opinion supported the decision even after the Offworld Newsgroup uncovered evidence of the harsh living conditions and brutal treatment of immigrants. Groups like Citizens For Tharsis' Survival congregated in Tharsis streets with slogans like 来得好!不然离开通过气闸!, (láidé hǎo! bùrán líkāi tōngguò qì zhá!, \"come properly! or leave through the airlock!\"). The historic animosity between Tharsis and Labyrinth continues in the present day.\n\nTharsis' economic power increased dramatically with the completion of the space elevator at Arsia Mons in 2042. Tharsis' population, industrial output, relative living standards, and freedom of movement on- and offworld made it attractive to business. Many inner city lines underwent gentrification as businesses moved in, bringing an influx of wealthy immigrants and displacing citizens into new ghettoes.\n\nIn 2079 Tharsis celebrates its 50th year with a Golden Week (黄金周) of national holidays.",

Identical rows of prefabbed tenement houses made of basalt fiber, sulfur concrete, and glass (three of the most accessible building materials on Mars) are interspersed with public squares and metro stations.\n\nMany central suburbs (or 'lines') were remade by private money as Tharsis grew in importance, tenements torn down and replaced by single-level siheyuan, traditional courtyard residences, and hutongs, long grids of alleys formed between the courtyards. Though the city has expanded horizontally rather than vertically, spaces for large buildings akin to skyscrapers ('subscrapers') have been dug into the cavern floor.\n\nThe Tharsis Metro, a mass transit system, links the lava tubes. Air travel is possible but reserved for drone cargo and emergency services, and is restricted from some lines because of unregulated and undocumented services like power lines, irrigation, and illegal adits or surface vents.

    "strDesc" : "Ring station was constructed in 2029 by Ceres Resource Extraction, an early space mining corporation established before modern spaceflight, which at the time was considered wholly speculative. However, as China and the United States' successes on Mars and Titan changed public opinion on the future of humanity in space, there came the perception that private exploitation of the untapped resources in the solar system would follow. With the advantage of seeming established, the CRE was able to finance the construction of Ring Station. A longstanding public misconception that an asteroid's wealth of platinum would crash Earth's market price for it was realized in 2032, albeit with minor details changed, when the first CRE shipment caused a market panic over nickel and cobalt.\n\nThe CRE was abruptly forced out of business by a cartel of its competitors in 2037 who coveted the resources of Ceres, and resented the CRE's success. In one of the first recorded acts of space piracy, the mining cartel seized Ring Station, as well as several of its ships; for the CRE, whose entire value lay in those assets, this was a devastating blow. The cartel renamed itself the CCRE, or the Coalition for Ceres Resource Extraction, and renegotiated contracts with the former CRE employees remaining on Ring Station. Perhaps wary of its own tactics being used against it, the CCRE began hiring private military companies to guard Ceres and Ceresian ships, a practise it continues in the current day.\n\nIn the 40s and 50s, the CCRE turned some of the manufacturing capacity of Ring Station towards building its own replacement, as the outdated habitat was becoming unsafe and prone to leaks. The second Ring Station was built around the first, and is approximately one third larger in diameter. It was designed by architect Gideon Pruitt to represent the efficiency and professionalism of the CCRE. The bright white colour, shape, and the cartel's reputation for creating wealth led to the new station's often derisive nickname, 'The Mint'.\n\nSeveral Ring Station-based PMCs were hired by Jovian corporations to retake Ganymede during the Ganymede Coup. In part because of this, and the suspicion that Jovian and Belt centers of capital would be naturally sympathetic, tensions between the Galilean Confederacy and Ring Station have grown pronounced in the decades following the Coup. Furthermore, both entities consider each other to be the proxy of larger, distant powers—the Confederacy for the interests of Titan and the CCRE for the interests of Mars, ie. Tharsis and Hangzhou.",

Attempts by Calico citizens to organise politically are prevented by the Coalition through its union busters, and organised violence or rioting is stopped by Coalition marines. Power and authority tend to concentrate in large, wealthy families; these families operate in a form of modern tribalism, which shares similarities with Mafias, corporations, and aristocracies.\n\nAt its inception, Calico City was likened to a frontier town of the Old West, set within a mining shaft of the Old West. Today, though the frontier element remains in spirit, the settlement's physical and social growth has made the comparison awkward. In short, Calico's prolonged arrested development by the Coalition has led to many of the tools of society and government to become second nature, ingrained within its citizens. Successful citizens of Calico are considered highly emotionally and socially aware, with a good memory for people and faces, as offending the wrong family on Calico can have disastrous repercussions. Offworld visitors to Calico tend to find the elaborate, unspoken social mores of Calico difficult to navigate, especially around topics like courtship, obligation, or promises, which are practically sacred.\n\nPerhaps ironically, though the Coalition's intent was to keep Calico in a state which would favour the production of cheap labor for its mines, using Calicoans has become markedly more expensive along with their cultural evolution thanks to their unique requirements and frequent difficulties in foreign environments.",

The prison is a panopticon. The prison advertises '100 cameras for every inmate', including several mounted on the prisoner's clothing. Correctional duties are conducted remotely from the warden's facility. Individual prisoners are subdued by sedatives or pain-inducers delivered through an autoinjector all prisoners must wear. For large-scale disobedience, the staff can also temporarily lower the oxygen in the air mixture of affected areas, triggering lethargy, hypoxia, and fainting.\n\nThe mean life expectancy of a prisoner in Prokofiev is six years. Surviving the first year, when the mortality rate is highest, improves life expectancy considerably.",

The objective is to touch a ball to a free floating target at either end of the court. A team can score a field goal by connecting the ball with the target defended by the opposition during play.\n\nPerhaps because of its competition with the system's other premiere sport, Freefall Fighting Championship (3FC), professional breakout has few illegal contact rules. The use of martial arts techniques or brute force to neutralise other players is encouraged. In most matches, the action and positioning required to block the opposing teams from scoring prevents the match from becoming a total brawl; however there are several notable matches in the sport's history which became exactly that.\n\nThere are two professional breakout leagues: the Outer Space Breakout League, OSBL, and the Mars Breakout League, MBL. Besides minor rule variations between the two, MBL is exclusively played in the 0.38 Gs of Martian surface gravity.<b>Origin:</b> Ceres",

While working in a scrum team on the excavation of Ceres, the engineers devised a way to entertain themselves during their break. Accounts vary between the creators, but the generally accepted version of events is that Sonny and Schneider attempted to play one-on-one basketball in a free cargo bay while Linh observed, gave feedback, and suggested rules alterations. It was Linh's fascination with the burgeoning 3FC culture that led to the use of martial arts to control contact in zero gravity, particularly with judo and other grappling techniques. By the end of the week, other teams on the station had formed a round-robin tournament adopting the trio's rules. The second such tournament featured five players a side and was streamed across Ceres.\n\nThe Mercer Entertainment Group approached the three creators in 2036, offering a promotional deal and a widely publicised showmatch to introduce Breakout to a wider audience. Sonny and Schneider accepted and went on to create the Outer Space Breakout League, a System-wide professional association for the sport. Controversially, Phạm Mai Linh refused the offer due to the loss of creative control over developing the sport for broadcast. She would eventually create the Mars Breakout League in 2042 in partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Sport at Tharsis Landing.",

Though the first voyages were underwritten by national banks, or directly by private interests, a group of Nigerian brokers sought to emulate the success of older financial institutions by establishing the Register of Ships. While other insurance companies would follow, Ogiso's Register became the first off world focused insurance marketplace. Today nearly one half of all off world insurance premiums are accounted through Ogiso's Register.\n\nOgiso's Register faced a setback when the incomplete aerostat Algiers vanished without a trace inside Venus' atmosphere. Ogiso's was forced to launch a suit against six hundred Agencies who refused to pay out the cover, as they demanded a public investigation. A spokesperson for the defendants claimed that the cause of the loss was most likely piracy or sabotage for which the aerostat was not insured, as the contract was created before the Venusian atmosphere's susceptibility to piracy became a known quantity. The legal battle, and the search for evidence of Algiers' fate, is ongoing.",

    "strDesc" : "Ogiso's Register offers a wide range of MAT insurance policies beyond the scope of this article. The list below is not comprehensive.\n\n<b>Total Loss Only</b>\nA form of insurance which only pays damages when the insured cargo or vessel is totally destroyed. TLO policies are considerably cheaper than other policies given the rarity of a) the event occurring b) the claimants surviving and c) proving the loss. Ogiso's contracts typically include, as part of its TLO Policy, Constructive Total Loss, when the vessel survives but repair costs are estimated to be greater than the vessel's value.\nDespite this, going without TLO can lead to millions, billions, in some case trillions' worth of loss. For this reason it is a very common policy off world.\n\n<b>Cargo</b>\nCargo coverage pays damages commensurate to the value of the cargo. More comprehensive cover includes situations such as damages caused during loading and unloading.\n\n<b>Hull</b>\nHull coverage pays for damages to the hull in the event of allision (damage from an interplanetary body, micrometeroids, or debris) or running down (damage from contact with another ship).\n\n<b>Voyage</b>\nVoyage policies last from the point of departure to the destination, the most common policy to apply to cargo.\n\n<b>Time</b>\nA time-based policy lasts for a particular period. A standard maritime contract lasts for one year. Policies covering time and voyage are 'mixed'.\n\n<b>Valued or Unvalued/Open</b>\nIn a valued policy, the value of the consignment is assessed and reimbursement is defined. In an unvalued or 'open' policy, reimbursement is only performed after any losses have been inspected and valued.\n\n<b>Port Risk</b>\nPork risk policies insure the safety of the vessel while it is stationed in port. Some ports, such as Athabasca in the Belt, the Register categorically will not cover due to the high rate of losses, accidental and otherwise.\n\n<b>Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotion</b>\nMost policies do not cover SR&CC, so these riders must be negotiated separately.\n\n<b>War Risk</b>\nCovers damage due to acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, rebellion and hijacking.",

Its goal was to explore alternative computing architecture in the face of the rising costs of lithographic processes. While designing tests for a system in development, Lai Ying Ho, then a Junior Engineer, developed the predictive-priority-interface as a tool to assist her own work, populating it with surveillance data taken of herself. Her tool was soon in use by her coworkers. Anecdotal accounts have an unknown manager misunderstanding the interface's origin and threatening to fire the entire floor for corporate espionage. When the directors realised the interface could become a mainstream success, they integrated it into their next-generation flagship devices. RST's first major release, the 公式 ('Formula') smartphone, leapfrogged competition, setting industry standards of usability and performance.\n\nRST soon expanded into disparate software and hardware fields such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high velocity data, cryptography, cybernetics, and wearable technologies. In 2050 Renbao Semiconductor Fabrication restructured itself to refocus the company's mission, renaming itself 'Renbao' and giving RST the remit to pursue its focus on the consumer electronics environment. Renbao was one of the major investors in the construction of Suzhou Orbital, and today monopolises 6% of its interior surface area.",
