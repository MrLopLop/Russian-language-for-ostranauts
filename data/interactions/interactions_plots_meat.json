With words of encouragement you bring them together in shared praise for The King, and a commitment to do his bidding no matter what may come.\n\nThe deity beckons you closer and you step towards the throne.You bow before him and the Goat Without End extends a huge hand that he places upon your head.\n\nIn an instant your mind is flooded with images you've never seen and thoughts you've never had. Possibility stretches before you as plains towards an infinitely receding horizon. For a brief moment you possess a knowledge so complete and wonderful it is as if you have become one with the universe itself.\n\nAnd then the pain arrives. An itching and then burning in your eyes that is so intense you cannot manage a single thought. You feel your eyeballs expand, your irises distend, and your pupils flatten before passing out from the pain.\n\nYou jolt awake sucking air into your lungs. Before you sits the idol you were so arrogant and foolish to assemble. Finally outside the living ship, you breathe the familiar atmosphere of recycled oxygen but it does nothing to dispel your deep sense of dread.\n\nSlowly you bring your hand to your face. You touch your mouth, your cheeks, and, cautiously, your eyes, to find what you already know to be true. The eyes of The Goat. It's a curse that will stay with you until the day that you die.",
